title: "I Told Elon Musk we Should Have Space Internet, Musk Announces Space Internet a Month Later"

I   had this great idea for putting data storage in space last month.
You know, you could host servers and back up all your data there.
This wasn't a joke. I really see this as a significant and inevitable part
of our future. [See my future technology predictions]({% post_url 2014-12-29-technology-predictions %}).

I wonder who would get a kick out of an idea like that. Maybe Elon Musk!

No response, but no problem. He's a busy guy.

I also sent the idea to the CEO of Backblaze, but he hasn't announced anything ;)
