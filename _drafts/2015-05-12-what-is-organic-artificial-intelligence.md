# Abstract

Artificial Intelligence, or AI is the science of making machines
that can act intelligently. However, conventional wisdom has limited the application
of AI not to the wide net of "machines" but of "computers". Organic Artificial
Intelligence or OAI begins with the assertion that computers are fundamentally
incompatible with intelligence as we know if it biologically. As an alternative,
We could build a machine–not a computer–whose fundamental components are not 
gates and switches as in a computer, but *probability paths* that are strengthened 
by learning.
