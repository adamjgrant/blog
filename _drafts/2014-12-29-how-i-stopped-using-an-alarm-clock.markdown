- Sleeping without an alarm clock is like having a superpower. [But it's totally possible](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/day-in-day-out/201212/give-your-alarm-clock-vacation).
- Really when you think about it, the existence of an alarm clock is a testament to your intent to not get adequate sleep.
  - By definition, adequate sleep ends with being rested and awake. The purpose of an alarm clock is to permanently interrupt your sleep. Therefore, it is your enemy.
  - If you're not awake in time to get ready for work, the lack of an alarm clock is not your problem, your problem is a lack of sleep.
- Wake up consistently and don't hibernate over the weekend. You need to get consistent daily sleep no matter whether you're in the work week or on vacation.
- As in my case, I'm not going to end my Saturday at 10-10:30 pm just because that's when I need to get to bed on a Monday night.
  - The solution is simply to get as close as possible. Stay out with your friends, but call the night earlier than you usually do.
