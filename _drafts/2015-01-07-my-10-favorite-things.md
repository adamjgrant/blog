Despite how consumerism-focused this list is, nobody paid me to write it.
These are honestly some of my favorite things.

- [Dyson DC35 Digital Slim Cordless Vacuum Cleaner](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/15841168128990754142?q=dyson+spot+cleaner+vac&espv=2&biw=1256&bih=1229&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.83134100,d.eXY&tch=1&ech=1&psi=z4-tVJiSDoG1ggSig4LICQ.1420660688401.5&sa=X&ei=5I-tVKSKGI2FNqjXgMgH&ved=0CEEQrRI)
  - Comes with a charging dock that can be mounted on the wall. I installed mine in my closet.
  - Cleaning small, one off spills is like taking a gun out of a holster. You just pick it up and
    point it at whatever you want to clean.
  - Best for spot cleaning as the battery life is about 10-15 minutes.
- [Canakit Raspberry Pi Kit](http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-starter-kit.html)
  - Dead simple, low power computer I can use for menial tasks like syncing my network of hard drives.
- [Asana](http://asana.com)
  - To me it's the ultimate task manager. I use it for everything...work, life, things I want to buy, grocery lists, etc.
- [180s](http://www.180s.com/)
  - Winter clothing and accessories are already bulky and annoying. 180s are a dead simple alternative to a hat. 
  - Stays on tight, keeps ears warm, doesn't mess with your hair.
- [Phillips Sonicare DiamondClean](http://www.sonicare.com/professional/en_us/OurProducts/DiamondClean.aspx)
  - An awesome electric toothbrush with several simple settings. 
  - Rarely needs to be charged, but uses an inductive charger disguised as an ordinary bathroom water glass.
  - Beautifully designed. The whole front panel is matte white, otherwise showing mode selections with a cleverly camouflaged display.
- [Quo Vadis Habana Notebook](http://quovadisplanners.com/notebooks/habana)
  - Better than Moleskine. 
  - Uses high-quality Clairefontaine paper.
  - Simple, unasumming design.
  - Thinner, yet stronger and better-bound sheets than other notebooks.
- [Global 8" Chef Knife](http://www.amazon.com/Global-G-2-inch-Chefs-Knife/dp/B00005OL44/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420662037&sr=8-1&keywords=global+8-inch+chef%27s+knife)
  - Great multipurpose chef's knife.
  - One single piece makes it both durable and easy to clean.
