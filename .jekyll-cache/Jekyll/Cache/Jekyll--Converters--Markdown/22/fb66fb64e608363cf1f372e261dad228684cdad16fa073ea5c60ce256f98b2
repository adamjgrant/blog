I"ö<p>I organize a monthly meeting at work called ‚ÄúTeach me Something‚Äù where my coworkers get together to listen to someone talk about their talent, skill, or something they‚Äôre currently learning.
Typically this is just one of us volunteering for that month‚Äôs meeting.</p>

<p>This month, I didn‚Äôt have a volunteer, so I asked everyone to show up with their home-brewed productivity tricks. Here are mine.</p>

<h1 id="i-use-an-app-to-delete-everything-on-my-desktop-every-day">I use an app to delete everything on my desktop every day.</h1>

<p><img src="http://cdn.everything.io/blog/productivity-tricks/hazel.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I use an app called <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com">Hazel</a> to automatically pick up everything added more than 24 hours ago on my desktop and stick it in the trash.</p>

<p>I hate having a cluttered desktop and within a given 24 hour window, there are usually critical files I need to swap between one app and another, or a screenshot I just took that needs to be sent off to someone else.</p>

<p>It sounds crazy, but I‚Äôve been doing it for years and love it. If I ever put something on the desktop I didn‚Äôt want deleted, I just go into the trash and restore it.</p>

<p>If I want to keep a file longer than 24 hours, I just don‚Äôt put it on the desktop.</p>

<h1 id="i-try-to-do-everything-i-can-in-my-calendar">I try to do everything I can in my calendar</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm writing another post that goes more in depth on this topic, but one of the most important things I‚Äôve learned about staying productive is that things are more likely
to get done if they have a time and a place.</p>

<p>Whenever I have the urge to take a note of something, I ask myself, can I not put this in as a calendar invite instead? Even if I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll get to it, I can
still pick a date and time that I can adjust later.</p>

<h1 id="some-apps-i-use">Some apps I use</h1>

<h2 id="mailmate">Mailmate</h2>

<p>This application is a great mail application for nerds. I won‚Äôt go into tons of details but the main things I use</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Keyboard shortcuts</p>

    <p>It has a shortcut for everything</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vim mode</p>

    <p>Press ctrl+O to open your message in MacVim. Save with <code class="highlighter-rouge">:wq</code> to get back to the normal editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Markdown</p>

    <p>Instead of introducing their own WYSIWYG editor, they removed it completely and let you write your emails in Markdown.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="better-snap-tool">Better Snap Tool</h2>

<p>This is a simple app that lets you assign keyboard shortcuts to window arrangements.</p>

<p>80% of the shortcuts I use are opt + command + left and opt + command + right to dock my window to the left or right of the screen.</p>

<p>But there is so much more I haven‚Äôt used.</p>

<h2 id="dash">Dash</h2>

<p>Dash was originally debuted as a cool way to search developer documentation across many different technologies.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs still great at that, but I‚Äôve always preferred just doing an internet search. Instead, I love its snippets feature.</p>

<p>Instead of putting bookmarks in my browser, I link certain key combinations to frequently visited URLs.</p>

<p>This is great for ticketing systems where URLs follow a certain formula. If in JIRA someone tells me to look at ticket 593, I can just type a keystroke to type</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>https://jira.com/browse/PRJ-
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And type in 593 at the end.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>https://jira.com/browse/PRJ-593
</code></pre></div></div>
