<p>â€œAfter the problem appeared in Parade, approximately 10,000 readers,
including nearly 1,000 with PhDs, wrote to the magazine, most of them
claiming vos Savant was wrong (Tierney 1991). Even when given explanations,
simulations, and formal mathematical proofs, many people still do not accept
that switching is the best strategy (vos Savant 1991a). Paul ErdÅ‘s, one of
the most prolific mathematicians in history, remained unconvinced until he
was shown a computer simulation confirming the predicted result (Vazsonyi
  1999).â€</p>

<p>This is the story about the Monty Hall Problem. A very simple puzzle of game
show statistics that goes against common sense. Iâ€™ve always liked this problem
but havenâ€™t found a way to explain why the answer is what it is until now.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem">The problem</h1>

<p><img src="http://cdn.everything.io/blog/monty-hall/3doors.png" alt="Monty Hall Problem" /></p>

<p>Suppose youâ€™re on a game show, and youâ€™re given the choice of three doors:
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1,
and the host, who knows whatâ€™s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3,
which has a goat. He then says to you, â€œDo you want to pick door No. 2?â€ Is it
to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>

<h1 id="the-solution">The solution</h1>

<p>Youâ€™re better off switching every time. 66% of the time youâ€™ll get the car.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re like me, you expected to get the car only 50% of the time. After all,
one has the goat and one has the car. Thereâ€™s not much more to it than that is
there?</p>

<h1 id="the-explanation">The explanation</h1>

<h2 id="a-conceptual-explanation">A conceptual explanation</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that your odds of winning were originally 1 out of 3.</p>

<p>Imagine instead of the host revealing the goat door, she just says to you, â€œIf
thereâ€™s a car in one of the other doors and you donâ€™t pick it, Iâ€™ll let you
know.â€</p>

<p>Itâ€™s basically the same thing. You are going to be told which one of the two
doors is a goat door, just not by opening it before you choose to switch.</p>

<p>So while your original door still has 1/3rd odds of being correct, the other two
doors, each having 1/3rd odds themselves, have basically fused into one. Just by
switching, you fall into the other 2/3rds.</p>

<h2 id="a-model-based-explanation">A model-based explanation</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s use <code class="highlighter-rouge">G</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> to represent cars and goats respectively.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G  G  C
â€“  â€“  â€“
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Below those doors, letâ€™s use <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> for the door you would switch to and <code class="highlighter-rouge">O</code> for
the door you originally chose.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G  G  C
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, you would have chosen the car but switched to the goat.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s establish one fact that will tie everything together, the door you switch
to will always be the opposite of your choice.</p>

<p>In every case, the doors will look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G  
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those last two doors are either <code class="highlighter-rouge">G</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">G</code>. Thereâ€™s no other
possible combination.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G  C  G
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O


G  G  C
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> door is always the opposite of <code class="highlighter-rouge">O</code>. Agreed? Letâ€™s move on.</p>

<p>You will pick the goat 2/3rds of the time.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      G
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O

      G
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O

      C
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The host will reveal a goat door 100% of the time.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G     G
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O

G     G
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O

G     C
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we established that the switch door will always be the opposite of the
original door.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G  C  G
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O

G  C  G
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O

G  G  C
â€“  â€“  â€“
   S  O
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Look down the third column and count how often you end up with the car by
switchingâ€¦2/3rds of the time. Beautiful, isnâ€™t it?</p>
