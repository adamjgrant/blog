<ul>
  <li>While these tips might work for readers with male partners, I think these tips are optimized for males in opposite-sex relationships.</li>
  <li>Also, I’ve never been in a relationship with a man, so I have no idea how to avoid arguments with them.</li>
  <li>Obviously, “Girlfriend” applies to “Wife” as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to stop fighting with your girlfriend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most men think their partners want them to solve a problem, but what they really want is for you to just fucking listen.
    <ul>
      <li>This is the number 1 problem men have in arguments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Don’t solve any problems before:
    <ul>
      <li>Your girlfriend has expressed how they feel about what is concerning them.</li>
      <li>You have made her understand that you can see things from her point of view. This must be done sincerely.
        <ul>
          <li>This absolutely must come first. Even if you feel the urge to say “But I didn’t say that!”. Say it after you’ve done this. She’ll be calmed down and validated enough to hear you out.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>And maybe not solve the problem at all. Are you even sure she needs you to do that?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You don’t have to agree with someone to be able to put yourself in their shoes and let them know you are doing that.
    <ul>
      <li>To you, their complaint may be silly, inaccurate, unfair, or whatever, but that’s not what you’re empathizing with.</li>
      <li>You are empathizing about how they feel.</li>
      <li>Maybe you did everything right coming home at the time you did, but you should start with saying you understand <em>why</em> they <em>would</em> be upset for having to wait and not knowing when you’d be home.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you have no idea how to empathize with the particular issue she has raised, that’s precisely what you need to work on before you can get anywhere else.
    <ul>
      <li>Empathizing needs to be sincere and not passive aggressive. You’re letting her know you’re feeling for her and also taking steps to understand for yourself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Never ever raise your voice or use insults. Once you’ve broken that seal, you’re pitting rationality against aggression.</li>
  <li>Your girlfriend gets an open door policy with you. Never compromise this. She should understand that she can always feel comfortable bringing up any issue with you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of you need to hold each other to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not walking away. However uncomfortable the conversation may be, walking away is aggressive.</li>
  <li>No “Empathy by example.” This is when you want someone to feel how badly something hurts by just doing it back to them.
    <ul>
      <li>However, it is okay to use past examples where the tables were turned to help them to see how you might be hurt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Again, no raising voices, no insults, no swearing.</li>
</ul>
