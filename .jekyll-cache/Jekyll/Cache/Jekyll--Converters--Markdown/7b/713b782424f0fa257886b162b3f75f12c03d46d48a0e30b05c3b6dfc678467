I"d<p>Imagine you are running. Because you’re running, your heart is beating faster, you’re perspiring, you’re nearing the end of a challenging run, so you’re also feeling a little negative about the experience because you want it to end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, someone comes up to you to have a conversation. They see you are still running, so they start to pick up their pace too so you can hear and respond to them. Soon enough, their heart is beating, they are perspiring and so on.</p>

<p>It’s a little weird to think of it this way, but you just transferred your feelings to that person because they needed to set themselves to your pace in order to stay engaged.</p>

<p>What is less obvious is how we do this in subtle ways as well. Most of us understand the less subtle nature of emotional transferrance: Walk up to someone with anger, and they’ll feel threatened and angry too.</p>

<p>But we know better, especially in professional environments where we keep our emotions and true feelings in check. Yet if we choose to speak at a fast rate, we have the jogger’s transferrance happening in that person’s mind. Isn’t that interesting? You are talking fast, so the listener must /think harder/. They have to stress themselves just a little bit to more attentively hear you than they would if you spoke slower. And this is to say nothing of tone of voice.</p>
