I"¦<p>Imagine you are running. Because youâ€™re running, your heart is beating faster, youâ€™re perspiring, youâ€™re nearing the end of a challenging run, so youâ€™re also feeling a little negative about the experience because you want it to end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, someone comes up to you to have a conversation. They see you are still running, so they start to pick up their pace too so you can hear and respond to them. Soon enough, their heart is beating, they are perspiring and so on.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a little weird to think of it this way, but you just transferred your feelings to that person because they needed to set themselves to your pace in order to stay engaged.</p>
