  <li>Every two weeks, pay off all your credit cards
    <ul>
      <li>As long as you pay every two weeks, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the due dates for every single account. If you make this cycle, you‚Äôll always pay on time.</li>
      <li>In case you missed the cycle or something happens with the payment itself, your chances are less that it will actually be late.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read up on your credit card perks
    <ul>
      <li>Most of us at least have one credit card, but we may not realize the kind of perks you get with it beyond the points.</li>
      <li>Many offer insurance on purchases, especially those for travel</li>
      <li>You may be spending needlessly on things like rental car insurance when all you need to do is pay for the regular fees with the right card.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The zero balance trick
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a dollar amount that is your zero balance so you‚Äôll never overdraft or have to beg for payday to come around.</li>
      <li>For example, if my number is 100 and my bank account has $1000, I tell myself i have $900.</li>
      <li>I use a spreadsheet to add a little money to this number every month, doing the calculation automatically so I never see my real balance.</li>
      <li>Whenever I get close to ‚Äú0‚Äù (not the real zero) and forget about that automatic bill payment, the slush money makes up the difference.</li>
      <li>Remember, you can always just ask your bank to take off overdraft ‚Äúprotection‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Set up a savings account you can use as a zero interest credit card.
    <ul>
      <li>For example, I‚Äôll keep $2,000 in a savings account allowing myself to take money out of it like a credit card‚Äìwhere I obligate myself to pay it back in monthly payments.</li>
      <li>Great for discounts where you must pay a year up front to get a lower monthly rate. Whenever I get a gym membership or sign up for an online service, I just put it on the ‚Äúcredit card.‚Äù</li>
      <li>Many online banking systems allow you to set up recurring transfers between checking and savings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hoard employee perks
    <ul>
      <li>Buy transit cards pretax</li>
      <li>Retirement contribution matching</li>
      <li>Not just gym discounts but thousands of weirdly specific discounts on everyday things many HR companies offer.</li>
      <li>Sometimes health insurance can be used for things like massages!</li>
    </ul>
