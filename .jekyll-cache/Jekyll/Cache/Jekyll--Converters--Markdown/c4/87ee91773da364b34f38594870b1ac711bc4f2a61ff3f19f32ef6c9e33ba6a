<p>When I moved to New York, I had almost no contacts and started going to networking events to meet people. Here are some pointers Iâ€™ve picked up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Put your phone away.
    <ul>
      <li>Your phone is a â€œdonâ€™t talk to meâ€ sign.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make yourself physically close to people.
    <ul>
      <li>People, especially at networking events, canâ€™t help but acknowledge someone standing right next to them.</li>
      <li>Itâ€™s not weird that youâ€™re standing there. Itâ€™s only weird for them if they donâ€™t do anything about it.</li>
      <li>I think some people have a hard time with this, because they feel like theyâ€™re being a creep by standing too close. However once people start talking to the person who is standing close to them, will quickly realize they are a normal decent person. Do you want to know what is creepy? Being the guy at a party who is standing there not talking to anybody.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Everybody is bad with names, so stop using this excuse.
    <ul>
      <li>Because, just like anybody else, I often forget names when Iâ€™m meeting someone every 15 seconds, iâ€™ve taken to just writing down the peoples names on my hand right in front of them. Sometimes they notice and ask questions. But itâ€™s only given us more to talk about. They also appreciate that Iâ€™m making the effort.</li>
      <li>For some reason, everybody thinks theyâ€™re a horrible person because theyâ€™ve forgotten someoneâ€™s name right after theyâ€™ve met them. I forget peoples names all the time, and I just ask them to remind me. Iâ€™ve never had anybody react negatively to this. Why would they? Iâ€™m taking a special effort to get to know them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Butt in
    <ul>
      <li>Your reason? â€œI just wanted to introduce myself.â€</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>People donâ€™t remember details. They only remember how they felt.
    <ul>
      <li>Donâ€™t worry about anything you think may be awkward or any missteps youâ€™ve taken. Just have a good time and get people to like you.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Business cards are dead and they suck anyway.
    <ul>
      <li>Business cards were invented because we used to have to wait until we were home to add the number to a phone book or call them from a phone that was fixed to a wall. None of those constraints exist today.</li>
      <li>Instead, ask for their email and write them an email right in front of them on the spot.</li>
      <li>This way, you donâ€™t have to go home hoping that theyâ€™ll pick up your business card again. Youâ€™ve already started talking outside of the party. The ball is in their court to respond.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
