<ul>
  <li>Trying to see absolutely everything instead of letting plans happen naturally.
    <ul>
      <li>Living in NYC, where a lot of friends come to visit, this one tops my list. Folks rush around getting stressed out trying to see absolutely everything without the patience and go-with-the-flow to enjoy any of it.</li>
      <li>Just be prepared to come back home not having seen everything you wanted. It‚Äôs normal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not calling your bank before leaving
    <ul>
      <li>If you bank doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre going to be in Tahiti, they may think charges from there are fradulent and automatically block them.</li>
      <li>Depending on your connectivity, it may be difficult to communicate with your bank that the charges are legitimate.</li>
      <li>Worse, it may happen on a day the bank isn‚Äôt open anyway.</li>
      <li>Take 5 minutes to call the number on the back of any card you intend to use and let them know where you‚Äôll be and when.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get on the plane as soon as possible.
    <ul>
      <li>Being on the plane sucks. When it lands, we want to be the first one off. So why be anywhere closer than the end of the line when boarding begins?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Buy an expensive lock
    <ul>
      <li>Baggage handlers are known to take off your lock without returning it to the luggage‚Äìeven TSA-approved locks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cheap luggage.
    <ul>
      <li>Even if you‚Äôre an infrequent traveller, bad luggage can ruin your whole trip.</li>
      <li>This is one of those few things that‚Äôs worth paying extra for.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Believing ‚ÄúFree Wifi‚Äù claims.
    <ul>
      <li>Hotel and restaurant wifi doesn‚Äôt have a devops team behind it to troubleshoot when it goes down. To them, the wifi is just a little perk.</li>
      <li>Some bars and restaurants will advertise free wifi to trap tourists. Once you‚Äôve already started a tab, the wifi ‚Äúisn‚Äôt working today.‚Äù</li>
      <li>Hotels will intentionally block your service provider‚Äôs signal
        <ul>
          <li>Update (1/3/2015) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/opinion/sunday/brazen-attempts-by-hotels-to-block-wi-fi.html?rref=opinion&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;pgtype=article&amp;_r=0">An article in the New York Times</a> backs this up.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I carry around a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LT8S5UE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">personal hotspot</a> that gives me the option to buy a day‚Äôs worth of wifi anywhere in the world for $10. It costs $100 and includes 5 days free.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Poor cost-evaluation of airline tickets
    <ul>
      <li>Your United ticket may be $70 cheaper than the Delta ticket, but United will charge you $50 each way to check your luggage whereas it‚Äôs free with Delta.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo">United breaks guitars</a>.</li>
      <li>You may be trying to fly as cheap as possible, but ask yourself if it‚Äôs really worth it not to pay a bit extra for more sleep the night before.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may have a great outlet converter the size of a grapefruit, but USB is already universal.
    <ul>
      <li>I haven‚Äôt brought one of these clunky things on a trip in at least three years.</li>
      <li>If you have a MacBook, you can buy a cable replacement for the charger to charge your laptop in the destination country.</li>
      <li>Your MacBook is now a USB hub and external battery. No converter needed.</li>
      <li>More and more things are becoming USB chargeable, even electric toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Airports are starting to provide USB ports.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
