  <li>The Subway Performer Circuit
    <ul>
      <li>For locals, the subway performers are often a nuisance but they can be a delight for folks living outside of big cities.</li>
      <li>The A and D trains run express up the lenghth of Manhattan, meaning they skip many stops. The longest skip is between 59th and 125th street.</li>
      <li>This long skip attracts many performers to load their shows onto this circuit. If you’re on an A or D train between 59th and 125th, there’s a good chance you’ll see a performance no matter what car you’re in.</li>
