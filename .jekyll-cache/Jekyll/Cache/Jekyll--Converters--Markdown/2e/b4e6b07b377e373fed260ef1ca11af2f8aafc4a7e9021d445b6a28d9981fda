  <li>The Subway Performer Circuit
    <ul>
      <li>For locals, the subway performers are often a nuisance but they can be a delight for folks living outside of big cities.</li>
      <li>The A and D trains run express up the lenghth of Manhattan, meaning they skip many stops. The longest skip is between 59th and 125th street.</li>
      <li>This long skip attracts many performers to load their shows onto this circuit. If youâ€™re on an A or D train between 59th and 125th, thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€™ll see a performance no matter what car youâ€™re in.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>When Grand Centralâ€™s dirty, tobacco-stained ceiling was cleaned and repainted with the now reknown blue zodiac painting,
a single spot of the original ceiling was left as a reminder to patrons of how it used to be.</li>
