- The zero balance trick
  - Choose a dollar amount that is your zero balance so you'll never overdraft or have to beg for payday to come around. 
  - For example, if my number is 100 and my bank account has $1000, I tell myself i have $900. 
  - I use a spreadsheet to add a little money to this number every month, doing the calculation automatically so I never see my real balance. 
  - Whenever I get close to "0" (not the real zero) and forget about that automatic bill payment, the slush money makes up the difference. 
  - Remember, you can always just ask your bank to take off overdraft "protection"
- Set up a savings account you can use as a zero interest credit card. 
  - For example, I'll keep $2,000 in a savings account allowing myself to take money out of it like a credit card--where I obligate myself to pay it back in monthly payments. 
  - Great for discounts where you must pay a year up front to get a lower monthly rate. Whenever I get a gym membership or sign up for an online service, I just put it on the "credit card."
  - Many online banking systems allow you to set up recurring transfers between checking and savings. 
- Hoard employee perks
  - Buy transit cards pretax
  - Retirement contribution matching
  - Not just gym discounts but thousands of weirdly specific discounts on everyday things many HR companies offer. 
  - Sometimes health insurance can be used for things like massages!
