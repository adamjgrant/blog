Engineering considerations
- Ergonomic
  - Purpose was not merely to "hold a lot of stuff."
    - Too much stuff = too much weight = contributes to back and posture issues later on in life.
    - Should be smart about what it holds. 
    - Should make the user think about what they're going to take rather than allowing him/her to throw everything in.
  - Reduces strain on back
    - Should share weight with hip strength to reduce strain on back.
- Should be custom-built to the items it will hold.

Design
- [Inductive charger](http://www.amazon.com/PowerBot%C2%AE-PB1020-Inductive-Compatible-Smartphones/dp/B00F6SPYJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420662922&sr=8-1&keywords=inductive+charger) compartment $20
  - Fits into custom pouch plugged into external battery pack
- [USB battery](http://www.amazon.com/Poweradd-Pilot-2GS-10000mAh-Smartphones/dp/B00ITILPZ4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420663125&sr=8-1&keywords=usb+battery+pack) compartment to power inductive charger $20
  - Now the inductively-charged items in the bag can be charged whether or not the bag is being fed power.
- [Inductive charge receiver](http://www.amazon.com/iQi-Mobile-Wireless-Charging-Receiver/dp/B00H0DDVBU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420663339&sr=8-1&keywords=qi+iphone) for iPhone $40
  - I love that this isn't a case! It's practically a sticker you can put on the back of any iPhone, even if the next iteration changes form factor.
  - These three above items form the perfect on-the-go-charging solution
  - Even if I have a regular USB device, I can plug it in directly to the USB battery pack.
- [Skyroam 3G](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LT8S5UE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) compartment
  - My favorite MiFi solution.
  - Decent battery life for a device of its class, no Sim card replacement needed.
  - USB powered, so can plug into external battery pack.
  - Should have an attached cord nearby compartment for easy plugging-in.
  - I could use a Qi adapter to take advantage of the inductive charger, but the device doesn't really need to be removed that often, and would require it to sit directly
    in front of the inductive charger, so meh.
- Power cord for charging battery and MagSafe device
  - A single powercord can be pulled out from the bag to charge both the USB battery pack and a MagSafe device (MacBook).
  - This should also have some sort of compartment for keeping it rolled up and out of the way.
- Laptop compartment
  - A simple compartment for the laptop to slide in. Should also have a MagSafe plug located nearby, at the top where the user can easily insure it's plugged in.
- Hip hook
  - a elastically-attached hook on the side of the bag to distribute some of the bag's weight to the hips instead of the spine.
  - Should be able to hook itself into the bag when not in use.
