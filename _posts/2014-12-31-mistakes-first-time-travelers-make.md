Mistakes people make when traveling

- Trying to see absolutely everything instead of letting plans happen naturally.
  - Living in NYC, where a lot of friends come to visit, this one tops my list. Folks rush around getting stressed out trying to see absolutely everything without the patience and go-with-the-flow to enjoy any of it.
  - Just be prepared to come back home not having seen everything you wanted. It's normal.
- Not calling your bank before leaving
  - If you bank doesn't know you're going to be in Tahiti, they may think charges from there are fradulent and automatically block them.
  - Depending on your connectivity, it may be difficult to communicate with your bank that the charges are legitimate.
  - Worse, it may happen on a day the bank isn't open anyway.
  - Take 5 minutes to call the number on the back of any card you intend to use and let them know where you'll be and when.
- Get on the plane as soon as possible. 
  - Being on the plane sucks. When it lands, we want to be the first one off. So why be anywhere closer than the end of the line when boarding begins?
- Buy an expensive lock
  - Baggage handlers are known to take off your lock without returning it to the luggage--even TSA-approved locks.
- Cheap luggage.
  - Even if you're an infrequent traveller, bad luggage can ruin your whole trip.
  - This is one of those few things that's worth paying extra for. 
- Believing "Free Wifi" claims.
  - Hotel and restaurant wifi doesn't have a devops team behind it to troubleshoot when it goes down. To them, the wifi is just a little perk.
    - Update (1/3/2015) [An article in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/opinion/sunday/brazen-attempts-by-hotels-to-block-wi-fi.html?rref=opinion&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=article&_r=0) backs this up.
  - Some bars and restaurants will advertise free wifi to trap tourists. Once you've already started a tab, the wifi "isn't working today."
  - I carry around a [personal hotspot](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LT8S5UE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that gives me the option to buy a day's worth of wifi anywhere in the world for $10. It costs $100 and includes 5 days free.
- Poor cost-evaluation of airline tickets
  - Your United ticket may be $70 cheaper than the Delta ticket, but United will charge you $50 each way to check your luggage whereas it's free with Delta.
  - [United breaks guitars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo).
  - You may be trying to fly as cheap as possible, but ask yourself if it's really worth it not to pay a bit extra for more sleep the night before.

Bonus

- You may have a great outlet converter the size of a grapefruit, but USB is already universal.
  - I haven't brought one of these clunky things on a trip in at least three years.
  - If you have a MacBook, you can buy a cable replacement for the charger to charge your laptop in the destination country.
  - Your MacBook is now a USB hub and external battery. No converter needed.
  - More and more things are becoming USB chargeable, even electric toothbrushes.
  - Airports are starting to provide USB ports.
