Mistakes people make when traveling

- Trying to see absolutely everything instead of letting plans happen naturally.
  - Living in NYC, where a lot of friends come to visit, this one tops my list. Folks rush around getting stressed out trying to see absolutely everything without the patience and go-with-the-flow to enjoy any of it.
  - Just be prepared to come back home not having seen everything you wanted. It's normal.
- Not calling your bank before leaving
  - If you bank doesn't know you're going to be in Tahiti, they may think charges from there are fradulent and automatically block them.
  - Depending on your connectivity, it may be difficult to communicate with your bank that the charges are legitimate.
  - Worse, it may happen on a day the bank isn't open anyway.
  - Take 5 minutes to call the number on the back of any card you intend to use and let them know where you'll be and when.
- Get on the plane as soon as possible. 
  - Being on the plane sucks. When it lands, we want to be the first one off. So why be anywhere closer than the end of the line when boarding begins?
- Buy an expensive lock
  - Baggage handlers are known to take off your lock without returning it to the luggage--even TSA-approved locks.
- Cheap luggage.
  - Even if you're an infrequent traveller, bad luggage can ruin your whole trip.
  - This is one of those few things that's worth paying extra for. 
- Believing "Free Wifi" claims.
  - Hotel and restaurant wifi doesn't have a devops team behind it to troubleshoot when it goes down. To them, the wifi is just a little perk.
  - Some bars and restaurants will advertise free wifi to trap tourists. Once you've already started a tab, the wifi "isn't working today."
  - I carry around a [personal hotspot](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LT8S5UE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that gives me the option to buy a day's worth of wifi anywhere in the world for $10. It costs $100 and includes 5 days free.
