- Stop treating the weekends as a magical bottomless bucket of time. When you subtract meals, bathroom breaks, sleeping in, the occasional laziness, you realize weekends are a finite amount of time that simply won't fit in all the things you put off during the entire week.
- If you can do it in a couple of minutes, just do it now.
- Never allow yourself to create a to do item without a time and a place.
- Tame your email inbox. 
  - Your inbox is not a to do list. Your goal should always be to have zero messages in your inbox.
  - If you cannot act on the email now, defer it to a calendar event to respond to it, or use a client that can delay items in your inbox like Mailbox or Google Inbox.
- If you find you have too many things to do, the answer might not be to start doing them faster but to do fewer of them. Quitting can be good. Start unsubscribing from things you can live without. Life is short.
