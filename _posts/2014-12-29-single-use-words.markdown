Together with Daniel Ryan Carter, I've been collecting some "Single Use Words." These are words that seem to remain
in the English language only because they are use in a single expression.

For example, "Trove." Do you really ever say "trove" unless following the word "Treasure"?

Here's the list:

- Sty (pig)
- Trove (treasure)
- Harrowing (tale)
- Whet (appetite)
- Mitigating (circumstances)
- Smithereens (blown to)
- Jilted (lover)
- Ulterior (motive)
- Wreak (havoc)
- Sleight (of hand)
- Ovation (standing)
- Tantrum (temper)
- Conniption (fit)
- Inclement (weather)
- Unrequited (love)
- Amok (run)
- Kink (hose)
- Fledged (fully)
