# If there's one takeaway from this article it's this
You're more likely to get something done if you have a time and a place.

To Do lists make it too convenient to not do this.

# Do you even need a notes application?
If I intend to write something down for later use, it ought to have a time and date.
There are exceptions.

# My calendar tricks

## What's going on this month?
Sometimes a lot of initiatives are coming to a close in the general area of a month.

    Project X will have specs ready mid-September

    Device Y should be available end of September

    Project Z will be full tested early September

I just want to know, when September comes, what is going on that month. So I make an event for the first day.

    "This month"

And throw in all these details in the description of that event. It gives me a quick access to a month-full of
general details.

## Throw it over the wall

I set up what I'm going to work on for the day, and as I complete items, I throw
them over the red "Now" line, making space ahead of my schedule as I go, which
tickles the reward center part of my brain.

## Standing events vs actual events

If my work calendar is red, I'll create a second calendar called "Standing Events - Work"
that is pink. This allows me to keep all my work stuff together in one hue, but
distinguish between unmoveable scheduled events like meetings and my personal planned
activities like "Respond to John's email" or "Investigate bug on staging".
