- The Subway Performer Circuit
  - For locals, the subway performers are often a nuisance but they can be a delight for folks living outside of big cities.
  - The A and D trains run express up the lenghth of Manhattan, meaning they skip many stops. The longest skip is between 59th and 125th street.
  - This long skip attracts many performers to load their shows onto this circuit. If you're on an A or D train between 59th and 125th, there's a good chance you'll see a performance no matter what car you're in.

  - When Grand Central's dirty, tobacco-stained ceiling was cleaned and repainted with the now reknown blue zodiac painting,
    a single spot of the original ceiling was left as a reminder to patrons of how it used to be.
