# Down with Grocery lists

I often eat at home which means I'm often at the grocery store. For some reason,
I just couldn't stand taking my grocery list with me. It had something to do with
trying to hold a basket full of things and continuously take out a tattered piece
of paper from my pocket to see what else we needed.

To solve this, I decided it's always better to get data from my head than from a
piece of paper. The trick is, our memory is optimal with lists of only **7 items**,
or to be more precise, [seven plus or minus two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two).

Rather than try to push this limit, I work within in it by stuffing my whole list
into a single "item" in the form or a picture. After I get done writing down my
grocery list, I draw a funny little picture using all those things. Drawing pictures
of people is easiest because you can make the fingers carrots, the eyes strawberries,
and so on. Surprisingly, it doesn't take that long to do this or to memorize the
picture.

This method works flawlessly, and I have to admit it's kind of ingratiating to answer
the question, "What do we need here?" with: "Onions, potatoes, carrots, gingner, pine
nuts, butternut squash, kale, tomato purée, filo dough, jerusalem artichoke, arborio
rice, vegan cheese, vegan butter, chantarelle mushrooms, rice wine vinegar, vegan
cream, and scallion" without missing a beat and maybe witnessing some confusion on
your wife's face.

# Numbers as food

So I started to wonder how else I could apply this. The 7±2 rule really gets to me
with numbers. There are a lot of numbers I'd like to memorize that easily go beyond
this limit. Naturally, "chunking" information together was a worthwhile strategy, 
but I didn't think drawing people with numbers for appendages was going to be very
effective.

Instead, I started assigning two-digit numbers to food items.

    99 Watermelon
    02 Cherry
    23 Banana
    18 Strawberry

...and so on.

This basically allows me to hack 7±2 into 14±4 ("Overclocking"?). Now the number **99021823** was no
longer 8 items but 4: **Watermelon, Cherry, Strawberry, Banana**.

The other nice thing about using food is the fact that we already have "chunking"
instincts with food. When I see strawberry with banana, I think of a smoothie. I can't
help it. Now it's really three things: **Watermelon, Cherry, Strawberry-banana smoothie**

I know, you might be thinking, "That's still four things!" but this is the strange way in
which our memory works. A strawberry-banana smoothie doesn't occupy two "slots" in my
mind because the natural companion to a banana in a smoothie (in my mind) is a strawberry.
You might have a similar instinct if I gave you the phrase "A peanut-butter and ______
sandwich". PB&J just go together because you chunked those two items together long ago.

When you think about the chunking you can do, you have to wonder what the limit really is.
Imagine the following memory aid, in terms of chunks:

    1. **Butter**y **Orange**y **onion** bread
    2. **Cauliflower** and **olive** pizza
    3. **Tomato** and **spinach** smoothie

That's 82302715443256 that you just memorized!

# An iPhone app that helped me

![Eidetic iPhone App](http://cdn.everything.io/blog/memory/eidetic.jpg)

There's a great app I use to help me form these associations called [Eidetic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eidetic-learn-remember-anything/id536240413?mt=8).
Eidetic simply polls you at random times to quiz you on things you want to memorize.
Once you've answered correctly a certain number of times in a certain amount of time, 
the item disappears from the list and is considered memorized.

So I'm the crazy guy with iPhone notifications that just say "Banana" or "Squash"
constantly, but hey, it's pretty cool to be able to memorize tracking numbers, addresses,
and random insignificant numbers that make people really think you're a weirdo, right?

And no, this post is not supposed to be an ad for an iPhone app, but if the creator wants
to give me money (or anyone for that matter) I will condescend to accept.
