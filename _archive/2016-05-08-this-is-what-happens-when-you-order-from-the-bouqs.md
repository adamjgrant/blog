Recently ordered an $80 bouquet for my mother for mother's day. I was excited
becuase TheBouqs.com offered same-day delivery. Here's what I ordered:

And here is the bouquet that arrived:

You'll notice it's not just the "flower quality" as a Bouqs representative
later alluded to...it's just the entirely wrong bouquet. This is something
you get in the clearance section at a 7/11 for $5, not an $80 bouquet.

Notice the bright colors instead of pastels, cheap flower choices like
tulips..tulip singular, instead of roses plural. If nothing else, just the
number of flowers in the bouquet is not correct.

So I reached out to the company and got this response:

It's unbelievable, isn't it? They rip you off of $80, send an embarassing
bouquet to your loved one, and tell you to take $10 in store credit to shut up.
Literally giving you nothing unless you buy more stuff from them.

Have a Happy Mother's day and don't make the same mistake I did by doing business
with The Bouqs.
