One of the first pieces of advice I got from a programmer was that you shouldn't think
of languages as "good" or "bad" but as a set of tools, each with a different purpose.
But how well do we know our tools? 

Recently, I took a closer look at popular programming languages to understand at their
core what makes them unique.

# C

# Go
# Haskell
